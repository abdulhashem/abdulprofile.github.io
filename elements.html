									<h2>Introduction</h2>
									<p>From a young age i have always been passionate about tech. I was known as the household IT technician becuase whenever someone had an issue with their computer i'm the person who was responsible to sort out the issue. I attended Joseph Chamberlain college to study IT. i managed to achieve a distinction which allowed me to further my education at Coventry University. There, i studied Ethical hacking and network security. I was fascinated on how the internet is developing and how threats evolve everyday. In my three years at University, i had exposure to ethical hacking and penetration test. Artificial intelligence and programming (java and java script). My proudest moment was my final year project. I created a thesis that enable me to further understand passwords, security and ACL's. This allowed me to achieve a first and the second highest in the computing that year from 300 students. </a>.</p>
